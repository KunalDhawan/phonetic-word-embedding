# English Phonetic Embeddings

## Preparing environment

```
cd embedding_english
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Creating the cython package

Create it using the make.

```
make build
```

We can test whether it's build sucessfully or not.

```
make test
```

## Training Embedding

```
make train
```

This will generate the `simvecs` file. For running it manually see options by running

```
python train.py -h
```

You can also download the pre-trained vector embedding.

```
wget -O simvecs https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16W-2b4vhd4HEWbr4IV2n190BeXKxSval
```

## Results

To see the embedding results check [result.ipynb](result.ipynb)

To generate the embedding scores for the dataset [embedding_score.csv](../res/embedding_score.csv) run

```
python dataset.py
```

This file is used to generate embedding charts in [results_method.ipynb](../src/results_method.ipynb).

## TSNE Plot

The TSNE plot for some of the words can be generated by [tsne.ipynb](tsne.ipynb)
